## Description

This project aims to enable computers to read text from images or scanned documents. 
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) serves as a bridge connecting the physical world (printed documents) with the digital world.

## Work Plan
1. Environment Setup: Prepare the tools and conduct research related to OCR.
2. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of images containing text.
3. Data Preprocessing: Apply sharpening techniques and contrast adjustment to the images.
4. OCR Implementation: Integrate OCR and develop text extraction functions.
5. Column Segmentation: Add logic to divide the text by columns and test the results.
6. Evaluation and Testing: Compare the OCR results with the original text and conduct iterative testing for improvements.

## Tools and Technologies
This OCR project leverages various tools and technologies to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in text extraction. 
Below are the main tools and libraries used:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Tesseract OCR**: An open-source OCR engine that supports multiple languages and highly accurate text recognition.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **PyTesseract**: A Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR, making it easy to use Tesseract's features within Python scripts.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library, used for handling and processing extracted text data.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations in Python, used for various image processing tasks.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for building the web-based user interface.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for writing and running code, used for experimentation and visualization.
